                                <h1>Cloud Somersaulting</h1>
                                <p>The Monkey King's infamous ability to travel or "leap" 108,000 li 
                                    (54,000 km, 34,000 mi) in one somersault. The ability, often 
                                    portrayed as Wukong riding a nimbus-like cloud, requires a magic 
                                    hand sign, an oral spell, a fist clench, and a body shake. 
                                    Wukong's master Puti Zushi taught this ability to the monkey 
                                    to give him a style of flying that compliments his penchant for 
                                    jumping.</p>

                                <h1>Seventy-two Transformations</h1>
                                <p>Also known as Multitude of Terrestrial Killers. A power originally
                                     learned by the Monkey King from his master Puti Zushi to avoid 
                                     the Three Calamities, sent by heaven to punish those who attain 
                                     immortality by means of Taoist self-cultivation. The Monkey King
                                      was given the choice between either learning the "Multitude of 
                                      the Heavenly Ladle" that permits 36 changes, or the "Multitude 
                                      of Terrestrial Killers/Earthly Fiends" that allows for 72, and 
                                      chose the latter. It allows the monkey to transform his body 
                                      into virtually anything, from humanoid forms to animal ones, 
                                      including small insects, to miscellaneous objects and even 
                                      entire buildings, or to simply change his size (from gigantic 
                                      to microscopically small). While fighting Nezha, the Monkey 
                                      King copied the latter's war form with three heads and six 
                                      arms, showcasing his ability to precisely alter 
                                      specific parts of his body. Overall, the "Seventy-two Changes" 
                                      metaphorically designate an endless variety of transformations 
                                      (not limited to just 72 in a literal sense), and in addition, 
                                      it is suggested that for each of the 72 Changes, Sun Wukong 
                                      has an extra life as well.</p>

                <p>Sun Wukong (Chinese: 孫悟空, Mandarin pronunciation: [swə́n ûkʰʊ́ŋ]), 
                    also known as the Monkey King, is a literary and religious figure 
                    best known as one of the main characters in the 16th-century Chinese 
                    novel Journey to the West. In the novel, Sun Wukong is a monkey born 
                    from a stone who acquires supernatural powers through Taoist practices. 
                    After rebelling against heaven, he is imprisoned under a mountain by 
                    the Buddha. Five hundred years later, he accompanies the monk Tang Sanzang 
                    riding on the White Dragon Horse and two other disciples, Zhu Bajie and 
                    Sha Wujing, on a journey to obtain Buddhist sutras, known as the West or 
                    Western Paradise, where Buddha and his followers dwell.</p>
